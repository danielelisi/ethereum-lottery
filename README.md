# Ethereum Lottery Dapp

This is a lottery app that lets you interact with an Ethereum smart contract deployed on the Rinkeby Test Network.

The front end is built in React because it makes it easy to interface and use the Web3 library.

If you have the MetaMask browser extension installed, you can interact with the lottery app sending transactions from the Rinkeby test network.
